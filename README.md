# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
### RISE 3.0 Internship Project - Data Science & Analytics

##  Project Overview
This project uses Unsupervised Machine Learning to group mall customers based on their Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. This helps businesses target specific groups with tailored marketing strategies.

##  Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled null values and performed standard scaling.
- **Elbow Method:** Used to find the optimal number of clusters (K=5).
- **3D Visualization:** Created an interactive 3D plot using Plotly for high-end presentation.

##  Tech Stack
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
- Plotly, Seaborn (Visualization)

##  Results
The algorithm identified 5 distinct customer segments:
1. **Target:** High Income, High Spending (VIPs)
2. **Careful:** High Income, Low Spending
3. **Average:** Medium Income, Medium Spending
4. **Spendthrift:** Low Income, High Spending
5. **Sensible:** Low Income, Low Spending
